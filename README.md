# 👨🏻‍💻 Customer Behavior Data Analytics Project

This project is an end-to-end **Customer Behavior Analytics** case study designed to demonstrate practical data analysis skills across Python, SQL, and Power BI.
It replicates a real-world business analytics workflow where raw customer data is transformed into meaningful insights for decision-making.

As a student pursuing a career in **Data Analytics**, this project helped me practice the complete process — from understanding the business problem to delivering the final analytical report and dashboard.
